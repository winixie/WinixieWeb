Pre-interview Code Project

Objectives

Use the Star Wars API swapi.co to generate a list of the films 
that a particular character appears in

Use plunker to build a working example.
•Allow users to choose a character from the provided JSON file
•Upon selection of a character, the UI should update to display 
 information about each of the films that that character appears 
 in Minimally: Title, and formatted ('Thursday, May 19 2005') 
 release date
•Do this with some kind of component-based pattern
•You can only use the API routes found the provided 
 'characters.json' file, and the data returned from those calls.
•Use css to make it pretty, styling is up to you!

Frameworks you can use
•Angular 1.x
•Angular 2
•React

Feel free to use any function library you'd like

Please include feedback with thoughts about the exercise.
